                        <p>My name is Mila.</p>
                        <p>I am a student at the University of North Carolina at
                        Charlotte. With a diverse skillset and a background that spans
                        International Business to Computer Science, I am eager to 
                        contribute to the world around me. I am passionate about community,
                        culture, and the human experience. </p>
                        <p>This website is here for you to learn more about me and what I 
                            have to offer. Thank you for joining me in my digital horizon.

          <h2 class="h2-story">My Story</h2>
          <p>I am deeply passionate about connecting the world.</p>
          <p>When I was nineteen, I bought a plane ticket that took me to China. 
            I had never been on an airplane before. This experience completely 
            transformed my life and reshaped my perspective on the world. Since then,
             I have been dedicated to understanding cultures, building global connections, 
             and finding ways to foster meaningful impact in the world.</p>
             <p>My academic journey reflects this commitment. After studying International Business, 
                I transitioned into Computer Science, a field that allows me to combine my interests 
                in technology and global collaboration. I appreciate the power of computers to unlock 
                solutions to complex problems.</p>
                <p>Now, I aim to thrive in the intersection of Computer Science and international business 
                    where I can leverage data to drive informed decisions and create 
                    connections across borders.</p>
                    <p>Through my work, I strive to bridge the gap between technology and global business, 
                        fostering innovation for a more connected world.</p>

        <div class="inner-1-text-2">
          <h2 class="h2-story">More About Me</h2>
          <p>I spent Summer of 2025 working as a Software Engineering Intern at Ally Invest. My tasks included
            working with AWS, Terraform, SQL, and Apache Airflow. I also worked extensively with 
            Python. I enjoy full-stack development, web-based development, and mobile application development.
          </p>
          <p>During the school year, I work as an Instructional Assistant in Software Architecture
            and Design, where I help to support students in their educational journey. I greatly 
            enjoy the experience and the opportunity to not only help others but also contribute to 
            the structure of the class and encourage meaningful learning.
          </p>
          <p>Additionally, in my free time, I enjoy volunteering in ways that help support my community.
            I enjoy working with organizations such as Rotary International and the Japan Cultural
            Association of the Carolinas. I also study Japanese and French, play video games, garden, 
            and enjoy trying new types of coffee beans in my espresso maker. Most importantly, I travel
            on self-orchestrated trips where I can practice my language skills, engage with the world 
            around me, and follow my dreams of visiting as many UNESCO World Heritage sights as I can. 
          </p>
          <p>My goal upon graduation is to begin working as a software engineer where I can provide
            my best work to my organization, engage with my community, and tirelessly innovate.
          </p>
          <p>I love what I do, and am eager for the opportunity to do it and do it well!</p>
